- 👋 Hi, I’m @emmanuelatindama
- 👀 I’m interested in Math/Data Modelling, Data science, Machine learning, and optimization
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD Mathematics candidate at Clarkson University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analytics and Optimization
- 📫 How to reach me emmanuelatindama@gmail.com
- 👀 I have implementations of the exercises from the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng (from Stanford)
- 👀 I also have implementations of coding challenges from kaggle (example. Housing Prices Prediction problem)
- 👀 The implementations are mostly in python and octave(matlab). The .m files are octave files, but can also be run on matlab. I used octave because it is free.
